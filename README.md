# Ray-Tracer
This is a project in "Introduction to Software Engineering" course.
This course is part of my bachelor's degree in Computer science at JCT (Lev Academic Center).

In The project i design a virtual 3D graphic scene, which includes physical elements (light source, rays, reflection, refraction, colors, shadows, transparency,diffuse and glossy surfaces).

For the best and fast performance, I add multithread and and additionally i use 3DDDA Grid algoritem.
The project emphasizes the principles of software architecture and OOP (TDD,Agile Development and Design Patterns).
